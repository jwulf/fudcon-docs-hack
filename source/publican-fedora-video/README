This version of the brand enables video to display in both Google Chrome and Firefox using whatever codecs are present on the system.
It also enables a book to be consumed by the FUDCon Docs Hack System.

It also adds the ability to suppress chapter and section label and number on xrefs in html and html-single output.

Use <xref xrefstyle="skynet-injected-link-1" linkend="linkhere"/> to get the plain target title as the link text.
