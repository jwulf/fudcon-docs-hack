Cross-site scripting enable:
http://enable-cors.org/

Have to put this in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:

<Directory /var/www/html/docshack>
  AllowOverride All
</Directory>

Copy the apache/docshack directory to /var/www/html/docshack

Make sure that include the .htaccess file in /var/www/html/docshack. It has the following content:
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin *

Apache permissions to create lock files and book output:
chmod -R s+G 
chown -R :apache 
on directories
docshack/books and server/standalone/deployment/TopicIndex.war/Books

This will allow Apache to build books there.


The server/standalone/deployment/TopicIndex.war/scripts/docs-hack-fixlinks.js script contains the URL for the scripts
It expects the scripts to be at the same URL as the docshack server, so if your docshack server is at
http://127.0.0.1:8080/TopicIndex
then it will expect them to be at
http://127.0.0.1/docshack





To Do:

Use JSON to retrieve the latest content spec from the server REST API for editing.
