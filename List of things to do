To Do:

1. Make the tooltip for the Edit button the content spec ID and server URL for the book.
2. On click of the edit button, use JSON to retrieve the latest content spec from the server REST API and display it
3. On edit and click submit: 
  a. edit the server-side project spec, and replace with the content from the post.
  b. Do a csprocessor push in the server-side project (perhaps have a checkbox for --permissive in the browser)
  c. Report the success to the client
  d. On failure, pass the output to the browser, and allow the user to try again
